## Introduction

PSBO Stemanika is a Web Application for the Online-Based School Registration of Vocational Highschool 1 Majalengka for manage the registration of the students in PPDB. The purpose of this project is to accomplish my task during the final assignment in my Majority, which is, Software Engineering.

In this project, I use AdminLTE for the template, and Other, for details you can see [here](#tech-stack).

The challenge here is that I created a databases with a relational table, i've never doing this web project before, so i think the challenge is that i have to think like database engineer. so which is a new thing for me to handle a web project, especially using the MySql, PHP, and JS. And the other challenge is i have to create the features with only 2 days, To see what features I made, you can see [here](#features).
